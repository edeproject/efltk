is the Data Source and why do we need it?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Different
sources of the information require very different ways to retrieve
that information. The Datasource allows to hide the nature of
information source behind the standard API, presenting information as
rows (if applicable) and columns of data. It is very typical that all
the rows have the same number of column types, and every column keeps
it's data type from row to row. Datasource provides the abilities to
open the information source and navigate through it. As soon it's
opened, it has the list of the columns, or fields. Every field has
the data type, width (size) and alignment, and, of course, you can
read from it the actual data. As result, we have an abstraction class
and can use it without knowing anything about the actual data. From
the point of the particular widget, it's just a set of rows of
fields. Widget opens the Datasource, reads the data, closes it. It
doesn't matter if that Datasource was actually a database Query, or
an FTP files directory. The widget has all the necessary information.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>How
can a Data Source be used?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>There are a lot of different usages of the Datasource in widgets.
Some widgets, like List View, can utilize the whole Datasource (DS)
simultaneously, by reading and displaying it completely. Some
widgets, like Dialog, can use just one row of the DS in a time. And,
finally, a lot of widgets can use just one field of the row in DS.
I'm not even going to consider a pity group of remaining widgets that
can't use DS at all. In eFLTK, every widget has a field_name() method
that allows to connect any widget with the field of DS. Where is the
DS? Well, widgets are not used by themselves. Usually, widgets are
placed in the group, so the group should provide the DS, if widgets
inside need it. So, Fl_Group defines data_source() method to connect
the group with the DS, and couple of methods to load and unload data
to/from widgets. By the way, it means that we may write to some
Datasources.</P>
<P>So, how do we read data from Datasource, and how do we write data
to it? Very simple. First, we open the DS:</P>
<P><I>my_ds.open();</I></P>
<P>Datasource uses Fl_Variant to store every field. To communicate
with DS we first find the field by the field name or index (in the DS
row):</P>
<P><I>Fl_Data_Field&amp; first_name_field = my_ds[&ldquo;name&rdquo;];</I></P>
<P><I>Fl_Data_Field&amp; last_name_field = my_ds[1];</I></P>
<P>Then we can just read the value from field, or write it to the
field:</P>
<P><I>Fl_String first_name = first_name_field;</I></P>
<P><I>Fl_String last_name = &ldquo;New last name&rdquo;;</I></P>
<P><I>last_name_field = last_name;</I></P>
<P>And , finally, we close DS:</P>
<P><I>my_ds.close();</I></P>
<P>Well, this is true for the abstract DS. The real Datasources
require to define some extra parameters prior to open(), like what
are we trying to open? In case of the database query it would be the
text of SQL statement, for Fl_Directory_DS it would be the path to
the directory, etc..</P>

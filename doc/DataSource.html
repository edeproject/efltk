<h2><font face="Clean"><font size="4"><u><b>1. What is the Data Source and
why do we need it?</b></u></font></font></h2>
 
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Clean"><font
 size="3">Different sources of the information require very different ways
to retrieve that information. The Datasource allows to hide the nature of 
information source behind the standard API, presenting information as rows
(if applicable) and columns of data. It is very typical that all the rows
have the same number of column types, and every column keeps it's data type
from row to row. Datasource provides the abilities to open the information
source and navigate through it. As soon it's opened, it has the list of the
columns, or fields. Every field has the data type, width (size) and alignment,
and, of course, you can read from it the actual data. As result, we have
an abstraction class and can use it without knowing anything about the actual
data. From the point of the particular widget, it's just a set of rows of 
fields. Widget opens the Datasource, reads the data, closes it. It doesn't
matter if that Datasource was actually a database Query, or an FTP files
directory. The widget has all the necessary information. </font></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Clean">There are a lot of different usages of the 			Datasource
in widgets. Some widgets, like List View, can utilize 			the whole Datasource
(DS) simultaneously, by reading and 			displaying it completely. Some widgets,
like Dialog, can use just 			one row of the DS in a time. And, finally, a
lot of widgets can 			use just one field of the row in DS. I'm not even going
to 			consider a pity group of remaining widgets that can't use DS at 			all.
In eFLTK, every widget has a field_name() method that allows 			to connect
any widget with the field of DS. Where is the DS 			connection in that schema?
Well, widgets are not used by 			themselves. Usually, widgets are placed
in the group, so the group 			should provide the DS, if widgets inside need
it. So, Fl_Group 			defines data_source() method to connect the group with
the DS, and 			couple of methods to load and unload data to/from widgets.
By the 			way, it means that we may write to some Datasources.</font></p>
 			
      <p><font face="Clean">Fl_Data_Source is the abstraction layer that 			hides
the essentials of every possible information source from the 			widgets.
It gives us the nice possibility to develop now the 			programs which will
use the Datasources that doesn't exist yet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Clean">So, how do we read data from Datasource, and how do
we write data to it? Very simple. First, we open the DS:</font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>my_ds.open();</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Clean">Datasource uses Fl_Variant to store every field. To
communicate with DS we first find the field by the field name or index (in
the DS row):</font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>Fl_Data_Field&amp; first_name_field
= my_ds[&#8220;name&#8221;];</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>Fl_Data_Field&amp; last_name_field =
my_ds[1];</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Clean">Then we can just read the value from field, or write
it to the field:</font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>Fl_String first_name = first_name_field;</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>Fl_String last_name = &#8220;New last name&#8221;;</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>last_name_field = last_name;</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Clean">And , finally, we close DS:</font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><i>my_ds.close();</i></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Clean">Well, this is true for the abstract DS. The real Datasources
require to define some extra parameters prior to open(), like what are we
trying to open? In case of the database query it would be the text of SQL
statement, for Fl_Directory_DS it would be the path to the directory, etc..</font></p>
 
<h2> <font face="Clean"><font size="4"><u><b>3. Minimal structure of a simple
Data Source.</b></u></font></font></h2>
 
<p style="text-decoration: none;">The Fl_Data_Source is an abstract class.
It means you can't creat an object that class - you should derive your Data
Source (DS) from Fl_Data_Source. Fl_Data_Source hase several groups of methods
the actual DS should implement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>open() and close() methods initiate and terminate the data access session<br>
  </li>
  <li>navigation methods (first(), next(), etc.. ) allow to move between
records in opened data source</li>
  <li>field access methods allow access fields and fields' data</li>
</ul>
To say it simple, all the abstract methods in Fl_Data_Source should be implemented.
The actual implementation may vary. Lets try to take Fl_Directory_DS as an
example.<br>
<blockquote><b>Open and close operations.</b><br>
First, Fl_Directory_DS reads the directory contents into an array of rows
of Fl_Data_Fields. Every Fl_Data_Fields object has a list of Fl_Data_Fields
for file name, file size, modification date, etc.. This covers the open()
method. The close() method simply releases everything allocated during open().
For the details please check the <i>src/widgets/Fl_Directory_DS.cpp</i>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Navigation methods.</b><br>
For Fl_Directory_DS the navigation is very simple. The class member variable
m_current keeps the tracking of current data row in the opened DS. It doesn't
make any sense for closed DS, of course. So, methods like first()..last()
simply change the m_current row accordingly.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Field access.</b><br>
Datasource should support the field information and provide field data when
necessary. As soon as DS is opened, the first data row becomes available.
At that moment, DS' current data row already should have the Fl_Data_Fields
initialized. Using Fl_Data_Fields fields, we can always extract the number
of available fields and information about data type of every field. Of course,
we still have to provide all this functionality through the Datasource methods,
but we already have all the necessary information.<br>
</blockquote>
 
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Every real Datasource also would,
probably, implement several datasource-specific methods. The general idea
is to provide all the necessary information for the correct open() of the
DS. For our precious Fl_Directory_DS such methods are directory(), pattern()
and several others. User should define the directory() and pattern() prior
to open() so Fl_Directory_DS would know what it has to open and read.<br>

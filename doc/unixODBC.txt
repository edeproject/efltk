Notes about unixODBC
::::::::::::::::::::

So far autoconf should be able to detect unixODBC on Your computer, but
sometimes user should manualy add one sympolic link in libraries directory
where libodbcinst shared library (DLL) is.

To do so, You have to log-in as root and try find libodbcinst.so file.
The best way is to use "locate" utility. When You find it, go to it's
directory and do something like this:

[root@pug lib]# ln -s libodbcinst.so.1.0.0 libodbcinst.so

Note that "[root@pug lib]#" is shell prompt :)

Than try to run eFLTK configure script again.


###
# Autoconf definitions...
###

After ./configure, we will have some substitued variables inside config.h
and makeinclude:

config.h

If unixODBC is found, HAVE_UNIXODBC will be set to 1, otherwise (or if
you've specified --without-unixODBC) it will be set to 0.

makeinclude

If unixODBC is found following variables will be set to valid values
UNIXODBCLIB
UNIXODBCINSTLIB (developers will discuss about this more, so it's not
	included yet)
UNIXODBCLDIR



Good luck!

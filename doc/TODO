                 TO-DO list for eFLTK.

These MUST be completed before first Release Candidate!
Please focus on these things now. 
That is - NO new features before these are completed!
=======================================================
Before RC1:
* Remove all code what we cant maintenance,
  Ie. Database, sockets, And some other non-gui stuff.
  This is ONLY due to lack of developers :(
  
* Complete and test UTF-8 related code for all platforms

* Complete Fl_Translator class for all platforms

* Separate and re-implement Fl_Device to it's own platform directories,
  like src/core/win32 and src/core/X11
  
* Remove all ugly tests, and make better ones

* Fl_Image + IO's cleanup (maybe reimplement lil bit :)

Before release:
* doc writing ;-)

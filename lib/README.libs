README.lib
----------

This directory is used as a destination for the libraries EFltk
compiles. "make install" will copy them to configure $prefix (/usr/local/lib)

EFltk will compile a number of libraries, the multiple libraries are
designed to avoid having programs depend on libraries they are not
acutally using. For instance if the OpenGL functions were put into the
main fltk library you would be forced to link OpenGL even if your
program is not using it. This is a design problem with present-day
implementations of shared libraries on both Unix and Windows.

The libraries are:

    efltk_core/efltk_ui - the core of fltk, most programs only need this
    efltk_images - functions that use png, jpg, other image libraries
    efltk_gl - Fl_Gl_Window and functions that use OpenGL

Under UNIX you can compile either shared or static libraries. Static
libraries are the default and have names like libfltk.a. Shared
libraries have (on most Unix systems) names like libfltk.so.2.  To
enable shared libraries run "./configure --enable-shared".

Under Microsoft Visual C++ a successful build of all projects and
configurations will contain debug (fltkd.lib and fltkdlld.lib) and
release (fltk.lib fltkdll.lib) libraries for you to link to.  Both are
built using the multi-threaded settings.  The DLL files (fltkdll.dll
and fltkdlld.dll) required for a complete DLL-based binary distribution
are located in the "visualc" directory. WAS: is this correct? What
about when you use GCC or BC++?

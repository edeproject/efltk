<a NAME="intro"></a>Introduction to the Equinox Desktop Environment</h1></center>
Equinox Desktop Environment is a desktop environment that should help users
to work with their computers. 
<br>The main goals of this project are stability, speed, good look and
feel. To reach the goals we have choosen FLTK2 GUI, which is the best GUI toolkit
under Linux and probably Windows too. To compare it with QT, FLTK has small memory
footprint and load fast. To compare it to GTK it is simple a suitable for beginers too.
To compare it to QT and GTK is it nice, with good look and feel.
We still try to do EDE better and better. And dont forget. If you think you want
some new feature or somethink do not work or is buggy please report it to us.
If you are programmer, designer, or you would like to write documentation,
or add some nice graphics, we welcome everyone.
EDE team wish you a lot of fun.

/*
 * "$Id$"
 *
 * vsnprintf() function for the Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK).
 *
 * Include this file instead of stdio.h to get the snprintf and vsnprintf
 * functions on systems that lack it (pretty much everything except glibc
 * systems). PLEASE FIX FOR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THESE FUNCTIONS!
 *
 * KNOWN BUGS:
 *
 * Field width & Precision is ignored for %%, %c, and %s.
 *
 * A malicious user who manages to create a %-fmt string that prints
 * more than 99 characters can still overflow the temporary buffer.
 * For instance %110f will overflow.
 *
 * Only handles formats that are both documented in the glibc man page
 * for printf and also handled by your system's sprintf().
